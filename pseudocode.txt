read known_rooms.txt to make room list

SQL: 
WHERE (day = dbDay1 OR day = dbDay2 OR day = dbDay3)

display room list



if the day selected is equal to one of the days that the room is occupied
as well as
greater than start time and less than end time (so within the range of the class)

then the room is NOT free
